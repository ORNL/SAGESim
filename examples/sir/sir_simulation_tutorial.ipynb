    "# **SIR Agent-Based Model with Behavioral Heterogeneity**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement an agent-based SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) model using the **`sagesim`** library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical **SIR model** provides a foundational framework in epidemiology for modeling the spread of infectious diseases. By extending it to an **agent-based model (ABM)**, we capture individual-level variation and interaction patterns, allowing us to simulate more realistic and heterogeneous dynamics of disease transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each **agent** represents an individual with a unique behavioral profile that influences their susceptibility to infection.\n",
    "- Agents occupy one of three states:\n",
    "  - **Susceptible**: Healthy, but at risk of infection.\n",
    "  - **Infected**: Currently infected and capable of spreading the disease.\n",
    "  - **Recovered**: No longer infectious and assumed immune.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transmission** occurs through interactions between *connected agents* (i.e., agents with network edges between them). Importantly, the probability of infection upon contact is **not uniform**. It depends on each agent's **preventative behaviors**, such as:\n",
    "  - Hygiene (e.g., handwashing, mask usage)\n",
    "  - Social distancing\n",
    "  - Vaccination status\n",
    "\n",
    "These behaviors are encoded as 100-dimensional vectors with values in \\([0, 1]\\), where higher values indicate stronger protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Transmission Behaviors**\n",
    "\n",
    "The infection decision follows these key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interaction Safety Evaluation**  \n",
    "   For each pairwise combination of the agent’s and its neighbor’s *preventative_measures*, a score is computed by multiplying the respective values. These products are summed to produce an aggregate measure of the *absolute safety of interaction*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normalization**  \n",
    "   The summed safety score is normalized by dividing by the square of the length of the preventative measures vector. This results in a *normalized safety score* in the range [0, 1], where higher values indicate stronger mutual preventative behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Infection Rule**  \n",
    "   If a neighbor is **infected** (`neighbor_state == 2`), the agent has a chance to become infected depending on the infection probability `p_infection`, reduced by the *normalized safety score*. Specifically, infection occurs if a sampled random number is less than `p_infection × (1 - normalized safety score)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **State Update**  \n",
    "   If the infection condition is met, the agent's state is updated from **susceptible** to **infected**.\n"

    "##### **Workflow Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this notebook, we will build a behavior-aware SIR agent-based model using the `sagesim` library. The following steps mirror the procedure outlined in the project README:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the `SIRModel` class**  \n",
    "   Subclass the `Model` class from `sagesim` to implement the SIR logic, including state transitions and transmission dynamics influenced by agents’ protective behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instantiate the model on a contact network**  \n",
    "   Construct a *Watts–Strogatz* small-world network to represent social interactions. Each node corresponds to an agent, and edges define potential transmission pathways. We initialize the `SIRModel` with this network and a population of behaviorally heterogeneous agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run the simulation and analyze results**  \n",
    "   Simulate disease spread over time and analyze how individual behaviors shape the epidemic curve and overall dynamics.\n"

    "### 1. **Define and Register `SIRBreed`**\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained earlier, we begin by defining a custom breed by subclassing the `Breed` class from the `sagesim` library. In the SIR model, we use a single breed to represent the general population. This breed is implemented as the `SIRBreed` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each agent in this breed has two primary properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`state`**: A categorical variable indicating the agent's infection status. We encode the three SIR states as:\n",
    "        - `1` — Susceptible  \n",
    "        - `2` — Infected  \n",
    "        - `3` — Recovered\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`preventative_measures`**: A list of 100 floating-point values that capture the agent’s individual behavior traits—such as hygiene practices, social distancing adherence, or vaccination status—that influence their likelihood of infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall we register step functions with specified priority levels to define how agents of a breed behave at each simulation step. In the case of the SIR model, we use a single step function that governs how an agent's state evolves over time—for instance, determining whether a susceptible agent becomes infected or an infected agent recovers."
