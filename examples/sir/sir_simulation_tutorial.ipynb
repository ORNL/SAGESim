    "# **SIR Agent-Based Model with Behavioral Heterogeneity**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement an agent-based SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) model using the **`sagesim`** library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical **SIR model** provides a foundational framework in epidemiology for modeling the spread of infectious diseases. By extending it to an **agent-based model (ABM)**, we capture individual-level variation and interaction patterns, allowing us to simulate more realistic and heterogeneous dynamics of disease transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each **agent** represents an individual with a unique behavioral profile that influences their susceptibility to infection.\n",
    "- Agents occupy one of three states:\n",
    "  - **Susceptible**: Healthy, but at risk of infection.\n",
    "  - **Infected**: Currently infected and capable of spreading the disease.\n",
    "  - **Recovered**: No longer infectious and assumed immune.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transmission** occurs through interactions between *connected agents* (i.e., agents with network edges between them). Importantly, the probability of infection upon contact is **not uniform**. It depends on each agent's **preventative behaviors**, such as:\n",
    "  - Hygiene (e.g., handwashing, mask usage)\n",
    "  - Social distancing\n",
    "  - Vaccination status\n",
    "\n",
    "These behaviors are encoded as 100-dimensional vectors with values in \\([0, 1]\\), where higher values indicate stronger protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Transmission Probability Based on Protective Behaviors**\n",
    "\n",
    "To model the influence of individual behaviors on transmission, we define the **effective transmission probability** between an infected agent `b` and a susceptible agent `a` as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_{\\text{eff}}(a, b) = p \\cdot (1 - s_a)^\\alpha \\cdot (1 - s_b)^\\beta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ p $ is the global base infection probability,\n",
    "- $ s_a = \\text{mean}(a) $ is the average protection level of the susceptible agent,\n",
    "- $ s_b = \\text{mean}(b) $ is the average protection level of the infected agent,\n",
    "- $ \\alpha > 0 $ and $ \\beta > 0 $ control how strongly protective behaviors reduce susceptibility and infectiousness, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation ensures that greater adherence to preventative measures by **either** agent leads to a lower likelihood of transmission."

    "##### **Workflow Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this notebook, we will build a behavior-aware SIR agent-based model using the `sagesim` library. The following steps mirror the procedure outlined in the project README:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the `SIRModel` class**  \n",
    "   Subclass the `Model` class from `sagesim` to implement the SIR logic, including state transitions and transmission dynamics influenced by agents’ protective behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instantiate the model on a contact network**  \n",
    "   Construct a *Watts–Strogatz* small-world network to represent social interactions. Each node corresponds to an agent, and edges define potential transmission pathways. We initialize the `SIRModel` with this network and a population of behaviorally heterogeneous agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run the simulation and analyze results**  \n",
    "   Simulate disease spread over time and analyze how individual behaviors shape the epidemic curve and overall dynamics.\n"

    "### 1. **Define and Register `SIRBreed`**\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained earlier, we begin by defining a custom breed by subclassing the `Breed` class from the `sagesim` library. In the SIR model, we use a single breed to represent the general population. This breed is implemented as the `SIRBreed` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each agent in this breed has two primary properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`state`**: A categorical variable indicating the agent's infection status. We encode the three SIR states as:\n",
    "        - `1` — Susceptible  \n",
    "        - `2` — Infected  \n",
    "        - `3` — Recovered\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`preventative_measures`**: A list of 100 floating-point values that capture the agent’s individual behavior traits—such as hygiene practices, social distancing adherence, or vaccination status—that influence their likelihood of infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall we register step functions with specified priority levels to define how agents of a breed behave at each simulation step. In the case of the SIR model, we use a single step function that governs how an agent's state evolves over time—for instance, determining whether a susceptible agent becomes infected or an infected agent recovers."
