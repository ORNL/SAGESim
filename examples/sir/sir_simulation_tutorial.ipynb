    "# **SIR Agent-Based Model with Behavioral Heterogeneity**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement an agent-based SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) model using the **`sagesim`** library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical **SIR model** provides a foundational framework in epidemiology for modeling the spread of infectious diseases. By extending it to an **agent-based model (ABM)**, we capture individual-level variation and interaction patterns, allowing us to simulate more realistic and heterogeneous dynamics of disease transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each **agent** represents an individual with a unique behavioral profile that influences their susceptibility to infection.\n",
    "- Agents occupy one of three states:\n",
    "  - **Susceptible**: Healthy, but at risk of infection.\n",
    "  - **Infected**: Currently infected and capable of spreading the disease.\n",
    "  - **Recovered**: No longer infectious and assumed immune.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transmission** occurs through interactions between *connected agents* (i.e., agents with network edges between them). Importantly, the probability of infection upon contact is **not uniform**. It depends on each agent's **preventative behaviors**, such as:\n",
    "  - Hygiene (e.g., handwashing, mask usage)\n",
    "  - Social distancing\n",
    "  - Vaccination status\n",
    "\n",
    "These behaviors are encoded as 100-dimensional vectors with values in \\([0, 1]\\), where higher values indicate stronger protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Transmission Behaviors**\n",
    "\n",
    "The infection decision follows these key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interaction Safety Evaluation**  \n",
    "   For each pairwise combination of the agent’s and its neighbor’s *preventative_measures*, a score is computed by multiplying the respective values. These products are summed to produce an aggregate measure of the *absolute safety of interaction*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normalization**  \n",
    "   The summed safety score is normalized by dividing by the square of the length of the preventative measures vector. This results in a *normalized safety score* in the range [0, 1], where higher values indicate stronger mutual preventative behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Infection Rule**  \n",
    "   If a neighbor is **infected** (`neighbor_state == 2`), the agent has a chance to become infected depending on contagiousness of the pathogen, which is represented by the infection probability `p_infection`, reduced by the *normalized safety score*. Specifically, infection occurs if a sampled random number is less than `p_infection × (1 - normalized safety score)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **State Update**  \n",
    "   If the infection condition is met, the agent's state is updated from **susceptible** to **infected**.\n"

    "# Implementing the `SIRModel`  with SAGESim ##\n",

    "1. **Define the `SIRModel` class**  \n",
    "Subclass the `Model` class from `sagesim` to implement the SIR model, including defining the space, registering breeds, global properties and agent and neighbor relationship creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define the `SIRBreed` class**  \n",
    "Define the breeds of agents in this model and their properties and register agent step functions. In this model we will have one breed of agent, called `SIRBreed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define the step function**  \n",
    "Define the logic that agents execute for every simulation time step. This includes state transitions and transmission dynamics influenced by agents’ protective behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Instantiate the model on a contact network**  \n",
    "Construct a *Watts–Strogatz* small-world network to represent social interactions. Each node corresponds to an agent, and edges define potential transmission pathways. We initialize the `SIRModel` with this network and a population of behaviorally heterogeneous agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Run the simulation**  \n",
    "Simulate disease spread over time. We will demonstrate how the model can be run within the notebook on a single rank and using MPI on distributed GPU computing system.\n"
