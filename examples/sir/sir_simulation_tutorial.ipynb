    "# **`sagesim` Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "`SAGESim` (Scalable Agent-Based GPU-Enabled Simulator) is the first scalable, pure-Python, general-purpose agent-based modeling framework that supports both distributed computing and GPU acceleration. It is designed for use on the latest generation of high-performance computing systems. This series of notebooks will guide you through using **`sagesim`** to simulate large-scale agent-based models (ABMs) tailored to your specific problem domain. The core workflow involves defining a custom model class that subclasses the base `Model` class provided by `sagesim`. This enables access to the built-in `simulate()` method to execute your simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building your model, it’s important to understand how agent data is organized and transferred across MPI ranks. In `sagesim`, agent data on each MPI rank is structured into **Agent Data Tensors (ADTs)** — CuPy-based vectors that store property values for all agents managed by that rank, optimized for GPU execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct your own model class, there are three main components you’ll need to implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Define and Register Breeds**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent in your model must belong to a specific *breed*. To enable this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define a breed class by subclassing the `Breed` class from `sagesim`. Each breed class is responsible for:\n",
    "   - Registering agent properties using `breed.register_property()` for each property.\n",
    "   - Defining the **step functions**, which specifies how agents behave at each simulation step, and registering it using `breed.register_step_func()`. Note that each breed can have multiple step functions, each assigned a different execution priority.\n",
    "- Register the breed inside the model’s `__init__()` method using `model.register_breed()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Define and Register the Reduce Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "`sagesim` supports parallel execution by distributing agents across multiple compute nodes and/or GPUs. After executing the simulation steps, different copies of agent data might exists, that is multiple version of adts. Therefore, a function is called to handles the logical combination (or \"reduction\") of those copies into a single consistent version. To enable this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define the problem specific *reduce function*\n",
    "- Register the *reduce function* in the `__init__()` method using `register_reduce_function()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is critical for ensuring logical correctness in distributed simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Create and Connect Agents**\n",
    "\n",
    "Define separate class methods that\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specify which breed each agent belongs to and assign initial values for the agent's attributes using `create_agent_of_breed()`.\n",
    "- Connect two agents, using `connect_agents()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Others: \n",
    "- If you have any global properties, they should be registered in the model class's `__init__()` method using `register_global_property()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CuPy Implementation: What It Means to You\n",
    "\n",
    "`sagesim` uses a **CuPy** implementation to support both NVIDIA CUDA and AMD ROCm GPUs. However, there are important constraints when using **`cupyx.jit.rawkernel`**. Kernel code must be written using low-level Python functions, as many advanced Python features and abstractions are not supported. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, when implementing your own `step functions` and `reduce functions`, you must adhere to these limitations. Key restrictions include (but are not limited to):\n",
    "\n",
    "- NaN checks must be done via inequality to self (e.g., `x != x`). This is an unfortunate limitation of `cupyx`.\n",
    "- Dictionaries and custom Python objects are not supported.\n",
    "- `*args` and `**kwargs` are unsupported.\n",
    "- Nested function definitions are not allowed.\n",
    "- Use **CuPy** data types and array routines instead of NumPy: [https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/routines.html](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/routines.html)\n",
    "- `for` loops must use the `range` iterator only — no `for-each` style loops.\n",
    "- `return` statements do not behave reliably.\n",
    "- `break` and `continue` statements are unsupported.\n",
    "- Variables cannot be reassigned within `if` or `for` blocks. Declare and assign them at the top level or within new subscopes.\n",
    "- Negative indexing (e.g., `array[-1]`) may not work as expected; it can access memory outside the logical bounds of the array. Use `len(array) - 1` instead.\n",

    "# **SIR-ABM Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to implement an agent-based model (ABM) of the **Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR)** framework using the **`sagesim`** library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **SIR model** is a foundational tool in epidemiology, used to describe how infectious diseases spread through a population. By adopting an **agent-based approach**, we simulate this process at the individual level, capturing the complexity and heterogeneity of real-world interactions that drive transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will have a fully functional **SIR-ABM simulator** that highlights how individual behaviors influence disease dynamic -- along with a practical understanding of how to apply **`sagesim`** to your own modeling tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement an ABM where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each **agent** represents an individual with unique characteristics, particularly their **preventative measures**, which influence their response to exposure. Agents can be in one of three possible states:\n",
    "  - **Susceptible**: Healthy but vulnerable to infection upon contact with an infected agent.\n",
    "  - **Infected**: Currently carrying the disease and capable of infecting susceptible agents through interactions.\n",
    "  - **Recovered**: No longer infected and assumed immune; they cannot be reinfected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Disease transmission occurs through interactions between *connected agents*—that is, agents capable of coming into contact with each other. Importantly, the probability that a susceptible agent becomes infected is **not uniform** across the population. It depends on the agent's individual **preventative behaviors**. Agents with stronger preventative measures are **less likely** to become infected upon exposure. Examples of such **preventative behaviors** include:\n",
    "  - Hygiene practices (e.g., handwashing, mask-wearing)\n",
    "  - Social distancing\n",
    "  - Vaccination status\n",

    "\n",
    "For the remainder of this notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",

    "   Create a subclass of the `Model` class from the `sagesim` library tailored to the SIR-ABM framework.\n",

    "2. **Instantiate the SIR model**  \n",
    "   Construct an instance of `SIRModel` using a generated *Watts–Strogatz* small-world network.\n",
